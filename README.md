The parking slot is booked via the website, which generates a random OTP and displays it to the user. The user, upon reaching the parking lot, has to enter the OTP in order to gain access to the parking spaces. They can view the status (vacant/occupied) of parking lots using the Virtuino app from Google Play Store.
